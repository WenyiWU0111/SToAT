# PLQ Composite Decomposition

## Background

As indicated in Theorem 1 of [^dai2023rehline], any positive convex piecewise linear-quadratic (PLQ) function can be decompose as a composite ReLU-ReHU function. The objective of this project is geared towards creating an automated Python and R library capable of converting a PLQ loss function into a ReLU-ReHU function. This will then permit the direct application  of ReHLine to resolve the corresponding Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problem.
