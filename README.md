# SToAT: Open Statistical Toolkits <a href="https://github.com/statmlben/nonlinear-causal"><img src="./figs/logo.png" align="right" height="150" /></a>

The **stoat** project is a comprehensive initiative designed to enhance the development of essential, foundational, and practical statistical toolkits. Its overarching aim is to widen the scope of operability and practicality intrinsic to statistical concepts and methodologies. The principles of the Stoat project can be underscored as follows:

- Open. **stoat** supports open-source, and all toolkits will be published in Github.
- Decentralization. **stoat** does not claim credits for every project or toolkit. Rather, all credits associated with a particular project are duly accorded to the respective developers and contributors.
- Cooperation. **stoat** involves active cooperation between developers/contributors and mentors. Most projects are initiated by mentors who propose preliminary ideas and aims. The project then is progressively proceeded through collaboration between contributors and mentors.
- Paid-position. **stoat** offers paid short-term academic positions, such as research assistant (RA). In short, each contributor selected for a **stoat** project will get paid academic position to work on an Python/R package for 12 - 24 weeks.

## Workflow

Developing basic, fundamental, and practical statistical toolkits comprises various stages, from conceptualization to release and beyond. Each step in the workflow is geared toward ensuring the toolkit is user-friendly, reliable, and addresses the key statistical needs of its intended audience. 

### Application Submission

1. **Initial Exploration**:   
   - **Research**: Contributors should start by thoroughly reviewing the list of available projects to find those that align with their interests and skills.
   - **Project Selection**: Identify projects where you believe you can contribute meaningfully. 
2. **Proposal Development**:   
   - **Idea Formulation**: Develop a basic project plan outline, including potential features and approaches.
   - **Related Works**: Search and summarize the related works of the selected project.
   - **Detailed Timeline Construction**: Create a detailed timeline with milestones and deliverables.
   - **Drafting a Proposal**: Create a detailed proposal with goals, methodology, and a preliminary timeline.
3. **Final Application**:
   - **Submission**: Submit the final application with the project plan and timeline for review.
   - **Approval and Commencement**: Await feedback and the go-ahead to start the project. 

### Post-Approval and Project Development

1. **Kick-off and Regular Check-ins**:   
   - **Project Initiation**: Begin work on the project as planned. 
   - **Regular Updates**: Provide updates and attend check-ins to discuss progress and challenges. 
2. **Development, Testing, and Iteration**:   
   - Focus on the development phase, with regular testing and iterations based on feedback. 
3. **Final Reviews and Launch**:   
   - Conduct final reviews and prepare for the project launch.

**Note (We Support Your Proposal).** If you have clear objectives and strategies for a statistical toolkit, you are invited to upload your project proposal in the discussion section. PIs will assess its feasibility and provide support accordingly.

## Acknowledge

**stoat** is initiated by several junior statistics PIs to contribute to the development of basic, fundamental and practical statistical toolkits. **stoat** is initially inspired by [Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc) initiative, and provides a more flexible timeline, research-oriented projects, and offers paid university-based academic job positions.
